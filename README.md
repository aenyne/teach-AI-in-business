## Book Resources
| Author  | Book  | Description & Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ethem Alpaydin|[Machine Learning: The New AI](https://libribook.com/ebook/4757/machine-learning-new-ai-pdf) |Graph Theory with Applications to Engineering & Computer Science|
| Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville| [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) | The book starts with a discussion on machine learning basics, including the applied mathematics and algorithms needed to effectively study deep learning from an academic perspective. There is no code covered in the book, making it perfect for a non-technical AI enthusiast. |
| Stuart Russel & Peter Norvig | Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd Edition | This is the prescribed text book for my Introduction to AI university course. It starts off explaining all the basics and definitions of what AI is, before launching into agents, algorithms, and how to apply them. Russel is from the University of California at Berkeley. Norvig is from Google.|
| Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David| [Understanding Machine Learning From Theory to Algorithms](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/copy.html) |---|
| Oliver Theobald|Machine Learning For Absolute Beginners: A Plain English Introduction|This is an absolute beginners ML guide.No mathematical background is needed, nor coding experience — this is the most basic introduction to the topic for anyone interested in machine learning.“Plain” language is highly valued here to prevent beginners from being overwhelmed by technical jargon. Clear, accessible explanations and visual examples accompany the various algorithms to make sure things are easy to follow.|
| John Paul Mueller and Luca Massaron|Machine Learning For Dummies|This book aims to get readers familiar with the basic concepts and theories of machine learning and how it applies to the real world. And "Dummies" here refers to absolute beginners with no technical background.The book introduces a little coding in Python and R used to teach machines to find patterns and analyze results. From those small tasks and patterns, we can extrapolate how machine learning is useful in daily lives through web searches, internet ads, email filters, fraud detection, and so on. With this book, you can take a small step into the realm of machine learning and we can learn some basic coding in Pyton and R (if interested)|
